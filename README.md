## SystemVerilog Mini Projects

The step up from my verilog mini projects. A collection of small SystemVerilog modules and testbenches. Each project is compact, modular, simulation-ready, and well-documented. This repository serves both as a personal learning log and a demonstration of my growing skills in SystemVerilog RTL design, verification, and simulation.

Projects are compiled and simulated using **Icarus Verilog** (with SystemVerilog support) and visualized using **EDA Playground** with `EPWave` for waveform inspection. Each project is carefully scoped for clear functionality and includes waveform-based validation.

### Requirements

- **Icarus Verilog** — for compiling and simulating (`iverilog`, `vvp`)  
- **EDA Playground** — for alt browser-based waveform viewing using `EPWave`

---

### File Structure

Each mini project includes:

- `*.sv` — SystemVerilog source files  
- `*_tb.sv` — Testbench files  
- `problem.md` — Problem statement and bash for compiling/sim
- `results` - Folder that includes images and a final report `REPORT.md`

---

### Future Goals

To build upon this foundation, I plan to grow this repository with more advanced and industry-relevant material:



*Verification & UVM Path*
- Begin exploring modular testbench structures and formal verification
- Prepare for industry-standard UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)

*Synthesis and Flow Expansion*
- Learn basics of **Vivado**, **ModelSim**, **QuestaSim**, and **Quartus** for RTL design flow
- Eventually work on FPGAs

*Project Scaling*
- Develop multi-module digital systems such as UARTs, ALUs, cache controllers, and basic pipelined CPUs
- Emphasize clean hierarchy, waveform clarity, and formal design documentation
